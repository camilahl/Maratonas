                            <p>The Parker Solar Probe was developed by NASA, having its first project
                                created in May 2008 by the
                                Applied Physics Laboratory at John Hopkins University.
                                Its initial objective
                                was to orbit the Sun, getting as close as possible to the star. This design was
                                worked on and perfected until August 2018,
                                when it was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located in the United
                                States.
                            </p>
                            </br>

                            <p>NASA renamed the probe to Parker Solar Probe in 2017 to honor Dr. Eugene Parker, who
                                created the basis for
                                studies of the phenomenon that we now call solar winds, since there would now be the
                                possibility of improvement upon the
                                studies of this phenomenon with the probe being so close to the star.
                            </p>
                            </br>

                            <p>On August 2018, the probe was launched, measuring 3 meters in height, 1 meter wide and
                                2.3
                                meters long, in addition to having a dry weight of approximately 555 kg. It has, in
                                its structure, a carbon shield that is able to withstand 1400°C, protecting it from the
                                radical temperatures encountered near the sun. Its new objectives, after improvements on
                                the
                                initial
                                project, were to examine the behaviour of the Sun, understand the reasoning for the
                                high temperatures in the solar corona and understand how it manages to cause space
                                weather effects capable of affecting the safety of astronauts. It also aimed to
                                comprehend the functioning of
                                satellites, energy networks and auroras in the Earth’s atmosphere. The acquisition of
                                this information is very important, given that at any moment there can be a solar
                                eruption
                                that is capable of disabling satellites and electronic devices around the world. Being
                                able to predict this information can give us time to reverse the situation.
                            </p>
                            </br>

                            <p>During its trajectory, the probe passes close to the Sun several times in an elliptical
                                path
                                that begins in the region of the Earth’s orbit around the
                                star, then it passes through Venus and Mercury until it passes by the astro, where it
                                returns
                                again to Earth's orbit. During each trip, the probe gets closer and closer to the
                                sun, needing to resist high temperatures and Alfvén waves, which are particles
                                expelled by the star’s surface forming the solar wind, an intense flow
                                radiation. Its final orbit is scheduled for 2025, this being its 24th trip around the
                                sun.

                            </p>
                            </br>

                            <p>In 2021, the probe finally managed to penetrate the outer layer of the sun's
                                atmosphere (known as corona), staying approximately 5 hours inside of it. It managed to
                                collect a lot of information about the star during the time it stayed there, such
                                as the measurement of high-energy particles, magnetic fluctuations and photos for
                                better understanding of the solar corona. A fun fact about the probe's cameras is
                                that it does not aim directly at the sun so as to not burn the lens. The spacecraft was
                                13
                                million kilometers from the center of the sun when it spent that period of time in the
                                sun’s atmosphere.
                            </p>
                            </br>

                            <p>In early June 2022, Parker completed its 12th trip around the Sun, coming within 8.5
                                million kilometersm of its center. The probe discovered a dust-free region around the
                                Sun
                                where grains sublime due to extreme heat.
                            </p>
                            </br>

                            <p>During the next 3 years,the probe should be able to reach up to 12 times close to
                                the Sun to get more information about it and, periodically, capture solar events
                                like eruptions on its surface. Up until now, its highest speed was 692000 km/h. The
                                expectation is that the probe can go up to 6 million kilometers from the Sun.
